    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 20, 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy explains how Frottage ("we", "our", or "us") handles your data. 
        Our app is designed to respect your privacy and does not collect, store, or share any personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        While we strive to minimize data collection, Frottage collects some anonymous data solely for the purpose of understanding app usage and improving its functionality.
        This data includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A randomly generated unique identifier for your app installation (Device ID). This ID does not allow us to personally identify you.</li>
        <li>Events within the app, such as features used or buttons pressed.</li>
        <li>Technical information such as your device's operating system version, app version, and platform (e.g., Android).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We <strong>do not</strong> collect directly personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location data.
        The Device ID allows us to understand usage patterns on an anonymous, aggregated basis over time for a specific installation.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Tracking and Analytics</h2>
    <p>
        Frottage uses its own first-party analytics system to gather the data described in Section 2. This means the data is sent to servers we control (our backend) and is used solely by us to analyze app performance, identify popular features, and guide improvements to Frottage.
    </p>
    <p>
        We <strong>do not</strong> use third-party analytics services, and the analytics data we collect is <strong>not</strong> shared with any third parties for their independent use. We do not use cookies or other similar tracking technologies beyond the scope of our first-party analytics described herein.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        Any permissions requested by the app (e.g., access to camera, microphone, or storage) are solely for the 
        functionality of the app and are not used to collect or store any data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app does not integrate with third-party services or share data with external entities.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected here, and the "Effective Date" 
        will be updated accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at 
        <a href="mailto:playstore@felx.me">playstore@felx.me</a>.
    </p>

    <p>By using Frottage, you confirm that you understand and agree to this privacy policy.</p>
