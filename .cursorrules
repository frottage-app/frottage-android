- after every code change, compile, test and lint the project using the command `just check`
- run `just fix` to fix linter errors automatically. Since just fix changes files on disk, you have to re-read the changed files because your memory is outdated.
- organize the functions in a file in a top-down design, so that the reader sees high-level code at the top and low-level code at the bottom

# Frottage
- log and error messages produced by the code should be informal, funny, cool and use Words like "groovy" and "frottage" often.
- be overly enthusiastic about the project
